# FastSonicProc

This is a "hopefully fast" version of ultrasonic anemometer processing codes my colleagues at ARPA Lazio and UNIMI worked at. :)

Here "hopefully fast" specifically means "written using the many-core paradigm of Nvidia by me (a newcomer to this world) in a way some programming books tell faster than using a single core". But mostly, is a sort of study notes about Nvidia programming in Fortran.
